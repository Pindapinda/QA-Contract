This repository is intended as an online appendix for a paper submitted to SummerSOC 2021 and contains a mock-up for a Quality Assurance Contract.

The contract can be easily be deployed and interacted with on test network. The tests provided in Tests/QA_tests.sol have been executed and compared against a human oracle for functional consistency. When running the tests, consider following the suggested order and make sure that the QA_test.sol contract is instantiated with enough Ether to create the supporting contracts.
